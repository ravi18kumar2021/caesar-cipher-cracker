# 🔓 Caesar Cipher Cracker App

This app uses a Caesar cipher decryption algorithm combined with basic AI-style word scoring to intelligently guess the original plaintext from an encrypted message.

🧠 **No decryption key needed!** Just paste your encoded text, and the app will try all possible Caesar shifts, then highlight the most likely English sentence.
